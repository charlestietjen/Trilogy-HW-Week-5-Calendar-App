# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The provided starter code had moment.js attached but I opted to use dayjs instead since moment is deprecated. 

I originally had planned to resubmit this project with all acceptance criteria met but did not have the time to implement the save feature in the end.

WHEN I click into a 

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
